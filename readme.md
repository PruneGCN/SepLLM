# Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e., separators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.

# Training

You can install the required packages in the requirements.txt. You are recommended to build an independent conda environment (or pyenv, etc.) to do this. Our code is based on the code framework [GPTNeoX](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox).

## Usage

All the code corresponding to training is in the Training-SepLLM folder. If you want to use the fused operators, just run:
```
cd Training-SepLLM
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
python ./megatron/fused_kernels/setup.py install # optional if not using fused kernels
```
*Note: If you want to use the Sep-Attention module, please make sure your Pytorch>=2.5.0. And set "USE_SEP_ATTN_KERNEL_ACCELERATOR=True" in your training config file.*

You can start training by:
```
python ./deepy.py train.py [path/to/config.yml]
```
The sample configuration yml files are in ./Training-SepLLM/sample_configs.

```

Remember to save your training checkpoints, so that if the training is interrupted unexpectedly, you can resume the training. You can set the saving directory in the configuration yml file.
```
  "save": "path/to/checkpoints",
  "load": "path/to/checkpoints",
```


After the training is completed, you can convert the training checkpoints to the Hugging Face format, so that you can test them on downstream tasks (e.g. using [lm_eval](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness)).

```
python ./tools/ckpts/convert_neox_to_hf.py --input_dir path/to/checkpoints/global_stepXXX --config_file your_config.yml --output_dir hf_model/save/dir
```
